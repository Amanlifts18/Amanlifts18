## 👋 About Me
I am an Automation and SAP Performance Engineer specializing in designing and delivering automated test frameworks and performance validation for complex SAP landscapes. I combine automation (Selenium, Java, TestNG, API testing) with deep SAP performance expertise (ST12, ST05, ST04, STAD, SM66, SM51), ABAP & SQL tuning, and load testing (LoadRunner, JMeter) to optimize system reliability, scalability, and user experience.

I enjoy turning performance challenges into efficient, scalable solutions—building tools and pipelines that speed testing, reduce downtime, and deliver measurable improvements in throughput and response time.

## 💼 Professional Experience

### Infosys Limited — Senior System Engineer (SAP Performance Tester)  
Jan 2024 – Present (Client: Apple)
- Led performance validation for a large SAP ECC → S/4HANA migration, ensuring optimized response times and system stability prior to go‑live.  
- Conducted load, stress, and endurance tests for multiple SAP modules (SD, MM, FI, PP) using LoadRunner Enterprise and JMeter.  
- Used ST12/ST05/ST04/STAD/SM66/SM51 traces and Dynatrace Davis AI to identify high CPU work processes and root causes.  
- Performed ABAP and SQL tuning, improving transaction response times by ~30–40% for key workflows.  
- Prepared performance reports and optimization recommendations that guided go‑live decisions and post‑migration tuning.

### Infosys Limited — System Engineer (Automation Tester)  
2022 – Dec 2023
- Built a Selenium + Java automation framework (POM, base classes, utilities) and migrated scripts to improve execution efficiency by ~30%.  
- Integrated TestNG with ExtentReports/Allure for better reporting and reduced debugging time by ~25%.  
- Implemented data-driven tests, maintained regression suites, and achieved a 98% bug-resolution rate in the first testing cycle.  
- Conducted shift-left sessions with stakeholders to reduce defect leakage by ~15%.
